# My2DGame

This is a simple 2D game project developed in **Java**, heavily inspired by a game created by **RyiSnow** on YouTube.

Most of the core code is based on RyiSnow's original project, with some modifications and additions made by me, such as new assets, extra features, and gameplay tweaks.

- Code structure and organization tweaks

## How to run the project
